## Overview
This is a app about places based on **Google maps API** and **knockout.js**. It
focuses on a neighborhood that I am interested in, and mark some interesting
places near it.

## How to use
1. Open index.html
2. When the page is loaded, you can see a map on the right, with markers of
interesting places. On the left there is a list of them.
3. Above the list, there is an input field for filtering. Place items in the
list will be filtered according to your input instantly.
4. When click some place item, the corresponding marker on the right will bounce
to show the place in map.
5. When click some marker, a street view image about that place will show up if
there's any.

## Note
If you can't retrieve a map view and you're in China, a VPN will probably work
that out.
